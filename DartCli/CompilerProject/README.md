# Hello, stranger!!

I will be using this project to learn Dart language along with the compilers discipline in my university (Feevale). That's the reason I'll be writing this in portuguese (and maybe someday I translate it, but I don't think I'll have time for this), cause it's my birth language.

Feel free to look at the class notes if you want to, they're on the NOTES_$lang folder.

You can also translate them and pull request hehe.
